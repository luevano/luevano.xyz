title: Lego sets

Lists of the lego sets I own, by their lego ID. I have other sets that I've gotten throughout the years, but they're either incomplete or in the "bonepile" of lego I have (they're disassembled and dumped in a bin).

# Owned

# Wishlist/missing

Most of these are just the sets missing from the ones I already have (take a look at the lego IDs) and it's just a way for me to keep an eye on them, as they're not really worth getting (price-wise). Will probably just get them at some point from Bricklink. `[R]` means retired (the ones I've checked).
