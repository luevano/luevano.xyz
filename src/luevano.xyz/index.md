title: Luévano's Site

## Welcome!

==Currently recreating the site with the updated pyssg, things might be broken.==

My name is David Luévano and this is my little piece of internet. I'm into alot of stuff, but mostly technology, drawing sometimes and... of course, gaming.

I have some sites setup here, such as a working [blog](https://blog.luevano.xyz/) where I post about whatever, an [art](https://art.luevano.xyz/) gallery, and other stuff (check the nav bar).

Also, yes, yes it is supposed to look like this. This isn't supposed to be a bloated *mOdErN* website; I use plain HTML and CSS and sometimes a bit of JS (meaning that I use no *rEaCt* nor *bOoTsTrAp*).
