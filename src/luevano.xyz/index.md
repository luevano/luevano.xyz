title: Luévano's Site

## Welcome!

==Currently recreating the site with the updated pyssg, things might be broken.==

My name is David Luévano and this is my little piece of internet. I'm into alot of stuff, but mostly technology in general, drawing sometimes and... of course, gaming.

I have some sites setup here, such as a working [blog](https://blog.luevano.xyz/) where I post every once in a while and an [art](https://art.luevano.xyz/) gallery; I've also got some other minor stuff too, such as a [git](https://git.luevano.xyz/) server. All of these also available on the top navigation bar.

I use plain HTML, CSS and a bit of raw JS for the site, nothing modern or bloated. Everything is built as a static site using my own tool [`pyssg`](${PYSSG_URL}) which is still a work in progress.
