# luevano.xyz

This is my website repo, where I (of course) keep track of everything I do.

This is only for version control, the way I "push" the content to my website is through a rsync command.

I shouldn't keep tracking of font awesome's stuff (or highligh.js'), but the files are really small, so I have no problem.

## Blog (blog.luevano.xyz)

The blog is managed via [``ssg5``](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html), [``rssg``](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/rssg.html) and [``lowdow``](https://github.com/kristapsdz/lowdown).

## Gameboy (gb.luevano.xyz)

Thanks to [Aaron Liu (HFO4)](https://github.com/HFO4) the author of [gameboy.live](https://github.com/HFO4/gameboy.live) for the gameboy emulator that I run in my server, hence the website.

## Static (static.luevano.xyz)

I also have a subdomain to keep all static content, just general stuff I use throughout my website.

Along my own stuff I also host:

* [Font Awesome (Free)](https://fontawesome.com/)
* [highligh.js](https://highlightjs.org/)

## Git (git.luevano.xyz)

This is not present here on github, since it's managed by [``cgit``](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/), but it's worth mentioning since it's present in my website.
