# This is the first blog post, just for testing purposes

I'm making this post just to figure out how [`ssg5`](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/ssg.html) and [`lowdown`](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/lowdown/) are supposed to work (and eventually also [`rssg`](https://www.romanzolotarev.com/rssg.html)).

At the moment, I'm not satisfied because there's no automatic date insertion into the 1) html file, 2) the blog post itself and 3) the listing system in the [blog homepage](https://blog.luevano.xyz/) (and there's also the problem with the ordering of the entries...). And all of this just because I didn't want to use [Luke's](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/lb) solution (don't really like that much how he handles the scripts... *but they just work*).

Hopefully, for tomorrow all of this will be sorted out and I'll have a working blog system.
