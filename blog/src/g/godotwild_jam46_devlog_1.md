## Brainstorming

Theme: Orb.
Wildcards (optional):

- I feel small: make enemies much larger than the player.
- Fear of the dark: make someone (or something) follow the player.
- Non-euclidean: have a map that is impossible in the real world.

- Need to protect an orb from big shadows following.
- Need to feed a big central orb. You're a tiny rat. You feed trash/flesh.
- Steatlh. Giant eye watching. Solve puzzles.
